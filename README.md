Hi I'm **JC** a recently hired *software engineer* at **MVI Ventures**, and I am thrilled to start my career in the tech industry. As a fresh graduate, I am a goal-driven individual with a strong passion for technology and anime. My enthusiasm for staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in software development is matched by my love for anime, which serves as a creative outlet and a source of inspiration
